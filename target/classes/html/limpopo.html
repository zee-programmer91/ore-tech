                <p class="text-col text">
                    Limpopo province consists of the vast Lowveld plain, which is interrupted by several mountain
                    ranges rising out of the Highveld plateau in the province's south and centre.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The mineral resources found in the Limpopo Province include the
                    platinum group metals:

                <p>
                    Previously, the mineral rights in South Africa were owned either by the State or the private
                    sector. This dual ownership system represented an entry barrier to the potential new investors.
                    The current Government `s objective is for all the mineral rights to be vested in the state, withdue regard to the constitutional ownership rights and security of tenure. The Mineral and
                    Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA), No 28 of 2002 transferred ownership of
                    privately held mineral rights to the State to enable any third party to apply to the Department of
                    Minerals and Energy for new order prospecting or mining rights over these previously privately
                    held minerals. In order to promote security of tenure and to secure existing prospecting and
                    mining rights, affected entities were given five years to submit applications for the conversion of
                    old order mining licences to new order mining rights.

                <p>
                    The iron ores in the Zandrivierspoot area have the potential to support a large scale mine. Sekoko
                    Resources (Pty) Ltd and Sishen Iron Ore Company (Pty) Ltd are currently evaluating the
                    economic potential/viability of exploiting these deposits. Unlike other mineral occurrences in the
                    MLM, the iron ores have the potential to support medium-large scale mining projects.

                <p>
                    There are gold deposits in the MLM area. Most of these deposits were mined and abandoned
                    because of the small size of the deposits and low gold price. The gold price has shown some
                    improvements in recent years. Detailed geological investigations need to be conducted in order
                    to determine the economic viability of exploiting these deposits. Copper can be produced as a
                    by-product from the exploitation of these deposits. Because of the small size of the deposits,
                    most of them can be exploited by small-scale miners.

                <p>
                    Dimension stone quarrying is the current major mining activity in the municipality and it has
                    potential to grow. Depending on the demand of the dimension stone and the production costs, the
                    MLM can grow to become one of the largest suppliers of dimension stones. Currently the
                    quarries export rough blocks. The opportunities exist for the dimension stone producers in the
                    MLM to start beneficiating on a bigger scale.
